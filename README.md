Allows you to extinguish the lanterns of the inhabitants in Echoes of the Eye.

The mod has two options, both disabled by default:
- Debug logs: Self descriptive
- Show names: All inhabitants have individual non-canon names many of which are references to various IPs. This option will let you know whose life you are snuffing out. You monster.
